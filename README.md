# Python Terminal Game
###### Version: 1.0
## Description and Usage
This is a simple terminal script written in Python that initiates a game of Tic Tac Toe and requires two players. The game is initialized with the game_menu() function.

The user will be asked to play with a second player and match three X's or O's diagonally, vertically or horizontally. First player to match three will win. 

When a win condition is met, the players will be asked if they would like to play again, and will loop until the players specifies not to play again.
